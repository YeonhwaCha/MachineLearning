The AT&T Facedatabase contains ten different images of each of 40 distinct subjects. For some subjects, the images were
taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement).
